Product Management Web Application
I have successfully completed the task to create a simple web application that allows users to view a list of products, add new products, and delete existing products. The application includes a responsive front-end built using React, a back-end built using Node.js and Express.js, and uses MongoDB to store the product data. User authentication is implemented using JWT.

Implementation Details
Front-end
I used React, a modern web development framework, to implement the front-end of the application.
The front-end is responsive and can adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
The application has a home page that displays a list of products.
I added a "Add Product" button that allows users to add new products to the database.
I added a "Delete" button next to each product that allows users to delete existing products.
Back-end
I used Node.js and Express.js to implement the back-end of the application.
I created RESTful API endpoints for product management, including GET, POST, and DELETE requests.
The API endpoints are designed to be scalable and can handle large amounts of data.
Database
I used MongoDB to store the product data.
I designed the database schema to efficiently store and retrieve product data.
User Authentication
I implemented user authentication using JWT.
Users must create an account or log in to access the application.
Running the Application
To run the application, please follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Kandulanaveennaidu/Product-s-Task
Install dependencies for the back-end:
bash
Copy code

npm install
Start the back-end server:
bash
Copy code
cd ../backend
npm start
Start the front-end server:
bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
npm start
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to view the application.
Submission
